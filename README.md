SNAKE
=========

An in-browser version of the classic game, Snake. Written in JavaScript with jQuery, HTML, and CSS.

The board is rendered with div "tiles", using jQuery to switch classes on the tiles to render the snake and the apple.

It may be atypical to use DOM elements to render a game like this, but it's remarkable that it can be done using such a simple and lightweight implementation.
